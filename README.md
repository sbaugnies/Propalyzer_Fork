- Operating Income
- Operating Expenses
- Cash on Cash Return
- Debt Coverage Ratio
- Monthly Cash Flow
- Scoring of area Livability, Crime, Cost of Living, Education, Employment, Housing, Weather relative to local and national averages
- Local natural disaster information
- Local school information
